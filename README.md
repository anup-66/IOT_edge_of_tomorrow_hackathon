# THIS IS A PROJECT CREATE UNDER THE IOT EDGE OF TOMORROW HACKATHON
# About -> 
Here we have created the mvp of an automatic bill generation system where we are using rasberrypi and camera to get the image and
using deeplearning model classfying the image used transfer learning(ssd_mobnet_320X320) .
we have a working website linked with the mongodb database and connected to rasberrypi for live data transfer and to generate the bill on checkout 
dynamically.
we are also having android app which is doing the same work as the web just to make it easier for the user to interact and have countability on our product.
